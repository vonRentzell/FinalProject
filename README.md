Final Project CSCE155 2021

  Instructions on how to use my code:
    First step is to run the main function and then a figure will pop up. Here you'll find an empty plot with many edit boxes. Enter your numeric values into the edit boxes separating each element with a space. Brackets are allowed but not necessary. The edit boxes will have default values already as an example. The length of values for the x and y data must be equal or a modal error message will pop up. The three text edit boxes can be formatted however you'd like.
    Clicking the 'Graph' pushbutton will update the graph with any updates made you made to the edit boxes. The graph will also be updated if you select a different radio button, and those will change the color or the style of your graphed line. The 'Reset' pushbutton will close the current figure and open a new one with all the default values.
